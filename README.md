# RadX

A minimal prototype of MVC framework based on RxJS. It allows the developer to care only about the logic (expressed as Redux reducers) and use her/his own UI library of choice.

As of now the framework itself is just a `radx.js` file with three functions; this project holds a minimal usage example.

I encourage anyone interested in this idea to discuss and contribute.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
